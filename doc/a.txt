php@7.2 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have php@7.2 first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@7.2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@7.2/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find php@7.2 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/php@7.2/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/php@7.2/include"


To have launchd start php@7.2 now and restart at login:
  brew services start php@7.2
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  php-fpm
